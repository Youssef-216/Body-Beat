# Body-Beat: a Connection Lab project
### Youssef Aouni & Yahia Beethoven    
## Concept:
Body beat is a unique web application that allows users to collaborate and create music by utilizing their bodies.
Through the utilization of motion-tracking technology, users can play various instruments by making specific body movements. This allows for a truly 
interactive experience that allows two people to create music together without having to be in the same physical space. Our team beleives that it is 
hay time to rethink the way people connect online and rethink the way we interact and connect online from a new perspective. Body-beat is an attempt
to encourage people to connect in a unique and fun way that includes physical movement, making art and unleaching their creativity. the platform has 
been designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. It featuring a basic user interface with a video feed that connects two users, as well as a set of
instruments that each user can choose from that can be drums or synth sounds. Through the use of motion tracking and a camera, the platform can detect 
the movements of each user and interpret them as notes on the corresponding instrument. This allows the two users to create music together in real-time,
regardless of distance.
